Building
--------
It is possible to build the entire API locally

1. clone https://github.com/Patchcoat/CRGA.git onto your machine
2. run ``cmake .`` or the equivalent for your setup
3. build the project
  * On linux with gcc, cmake will generate a makefile. You can build the project by typing "make" into the terminal
  * On windows with the visual studio compiler, cmake will generate an sln and several vxcproj files. This can be built within visual studio, or by running ``msbuild crga.sln``
